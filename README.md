# Handout for Niko's presentation in Freiburg Workshop at 20.07.2016

This handout discusses few important topics which I think are not addressed well enough in our current workflows. There are of course gazillion thing one could pick up, but I selected these two as they are relevant right now and probably deserve more attention.

- Keeping track of related session files (multiple audio, multiple video)
- Citing individual resources in the corpora (from practical point of view)

This document can be read [here](https://nikopartanen.github.io/freiburg-handout/) and the PDF file available [here](https://nikopartanen.github.io/freiburg-handout/partanen-freiburg-handout.pdf). Although I'm very fond of making research reproducible, this handout totally is not. There are some bells and whistles which one probably can set up anywhere, but at the moment it also needs access to our corpus files. However, it is not unrealistic at all to refer directly to archived items so in principle this local access would not be necessary.

The handout is also nice example from the working method where one can produce good looking PDF and HTML from the same source document. This demands some special attention to the ways how PDF output gets rendered through LaTeX and HTML needs some custom CSS to accomplish something similar, but this is often more a detail than a real problem.
